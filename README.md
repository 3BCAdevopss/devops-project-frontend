🚀 Deployment (Vercel)
Deployment Steps:

Connected GitHub repository to Vercel

Selected frontend repository

Configured build settings:

Build Command: npm run build

Output Directory: build

Automatic deployment triggered on every push to main

Environment variables configured for backend API integration

🌐 Live URL:
👉 https://devops-project-frontend.vercel.app

🔗 Backend Integration

Frontend communicates with backend APIs

API base URL configured in frontend services

Backend deployed separately and consumed via REST APIs

End-to-end integration tested on Vercel deployment

⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions
🔴 SonarCloud Issues

Initial analysis failed due to:

Missing coverage

ESLint warnings

Solution:

Fixed lint issues

Adjusted SonarCloud configuration

Re-ran analysis until Quality Gate passed

🔴 GitHub Pages & Deployment Confusion

Faced 404 errors during initial GitHub Pages setup

Issues with homepage configuration and gh-pages

Solution:

Corrected homepage in package.json

Ensured proper branch and folder selection

Understood custom domain vs GitHub Pages behavior

🔴 Vercel Deployment Issues

Build failures due to environment variable mismatch

Backend API not reachable initially

Solution:

Added correct environment variables in Vercel

Verified API endpoints

Rebuilt and redeployed successfully
